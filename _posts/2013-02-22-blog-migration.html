description: For those that have been following along, I have been forced to migrate my blogs to a new home.  Thankfully I have a very convenient new home for them to go to - my own comfy little server.  It's not much, but at least it pays for itself and gives us a little extra funding as well.  All of this trouble was due to Posterous shutting down at the end of April this year.  I originally liked the service because it allowed me to send an email with attachments to it for post creation and it auto published to Facebook, Twitter, and a few other places.

<p>For those that have been following along, I have been forced to migrate my blogs to a new home.  Thankfully I have a very convenient new home for them to go to - my own comfy little server.  It's not much, but at least it pays for itself and gives us a little extra funding as well.  All of this trouble was due to Posterous shutting down at the end of April this year.  I originally liked the service because it allowed me to send an email with attachments to it for post creation and it auto published to Facebook, Twitter, and a few other places.  With a few hours work, I was able to get a Wordpress blog to do roughly the same thing, although it was a bit of a hassle up front.  In any case, things have been moved over and I believe thing will be much more stable from this point forward.  Even if I have to migrate things to a new server, Wordpress isn't going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
