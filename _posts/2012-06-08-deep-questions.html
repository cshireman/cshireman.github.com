<p>I'm reading a book called 'App Empire' in which the author describes methods for building a mobile app based business. &nbsp;It's part of my <a href="http://30dayexpert.posterous.com" title="30 Day Expert" target="_blank">30 Day Expert</a> blog learning exercise. &nbsp;In any case, there are some rather deep and thought provoking questions in the second chapter which I would like to answer here:</p>
<p>Q: What will I do with the newfound feedom that I'll have (when the app business takes off)?<br />A: Simple - spend it with my family. &nbsp;Even though I work from home most of the time, it seems like I miss out on a lot of the stuff that happens with Heather and the girls. &nbsp;I would love to be a bigger part of that.</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;Who am I do this for? Why?<br />A: Again, simple - my family. &nbsp;I want to be able to give them everything they deserve and more - without having to consult the bank account first. &nbsp;If we decide to go out to dinner - fantastic. &nbsp;If we want to eat here - also great. &nbsp;If we need ot replace the sprinkler in the back yard we shouldn't have to wait for the next pay day. I want us to be free!</p>
<p>Q: How will being successful at this change the lives of my loved ones?<br />A: I'll be more available to them, which will hopefully be a good thing. &nbsp;I also hope that having enough funding to do the things we want to do, when we want to do them, will be liberating. &nbsp;It really sucks to not be able to get the things you need because you have to wait for your next paycheck.</p>
<p>Q; What am I commited to doing to guarantee my success?<br />A: This is actually the hard one. &nbsp;The best answer I can come up with quickly is to keep trying ideas and learning from them as I go. &nbsp;I recently had an idea for an app that let people find each other using their GPS coordinates. &nbsp;It turns out this app is already available - for free. &nbsp;Maybe I'll find a way to tweak the idea to make it better, but come up with something completely different. &nbsp;Who knows, but I'll just keep going and learning.</p>
<p>There you go, I have answered the five deep questions necessary to become an App Business God. &nbsp;What's next - more app ideas, and hopefully lots of learning about what makes for a really good app.</p>
