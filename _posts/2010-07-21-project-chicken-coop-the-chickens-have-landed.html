<p>The chickens are here!  I got the call about 7:15 this morning to come get them from the post office.  There are 26 total, all in good health as far as we can tell.  I'm very glad I turned the heat lamp on first thing this morning.  Heather finished setting up the 'mini-coop' with the litter, water, and feeders while I went to go get them.  Zoe doesn't quite know what to make of them at this point, but I'm sure she will come around.  I still need to add the chicken wire to the spaces between the rafters and the walls of the chicken house, that will get done tonight.  Right now, I am just glad that they got here, all alive and healthy, and that the coop got up in time!</p>
