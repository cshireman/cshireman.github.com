    It was an interesting atmosphere in the office today, very quiet, very calm. At least it seemed that way to me while I was tucked away in my little corner of the world. I was able to focus on my current projects and actually get some work done. It must have been the rain or something, but by the time I actually got around to talking to someone it was 2:30 int he afternoon!
<p> There seems to be this constant push in the working world to constantly be in contact, to be reachable, and to be available for everyone's smallest whim. The problem is that this kind of constant bombardment doesn't allow you to ever really focus in on the task at hand and get things done. I can't tell you how many times I have gotten more work done at home with the phone off than in the office with the phone, email, and co-workers coming by to disturb me. So, while I have said this many times, I will say it again here just for emphasis: Interruptions Suck! If people could save all of their interruptions for the end of the day I would be a happy camper for the rest of my days.
<p> It's late, why am I typing when I should be in bed. Goodnight everyone!
