<p>It never ceases to amaze me how much wild life there is running around Atascadero neighborhoods.&nbsp; Since we moved there we have seen these not so run-of-the-mill animals in and around our neighborhood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skunks</li>
<li>Foxes</li>
<li>Deer</li>
<li>Wild Turkeys</li>
<li>Quail</li>
<li>Coyotes</li>
<li>Beavers</li>
<li>Taranchulas</li>
</ul>
<p>All very cool, except for the skunk which spared our dog.&nbsp; The Deer were cool until one of them came into our driveway and started munching on Heathers flowers.&nbsp; If a Bear or Mountain Lion&nbsp;comes walking down our street we may have to reconsider where we live, but for now this has been one of the cooler things about living in A-Town.</p>
