    The birds have gotten about three times as big as when we first got them, and the coop is getting very, very crowded. They need to get out soon, so I spent the weekend building a chicken run. It's 14 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 7 feet tall. Heather and Zoe went to Fresno for Jasmines birthday, so it was just me. Total cost for the chicken run was $320, bringing the total cost for the coop up to $1,320. There are still a few things left to do, so I expect the price to get to at least $1,350. I'm actually very happy with this amount, as there are several commercial coops available that cost more than that, have less space, and do not include a run. Total time to recover based on expected income rate from selling eggs and the amount we save on buying chicken at the market is 3 years. After that, it's all profit!
<p> I didn't use pressure treated wood, but that only gets you a few extra years anyway. The roof is corrugated PVC plastic, and the sides are mostly (big surprise) chicken wire. I started digging Saturday morning, and finished at 8pm Sunday evening.
<p> Here's what I did, in case anyone wants to repeat it.
<p> Step 1: Dig trench <br />Step 2: Add wall <br />Step 3: Add second wall <br />Step 4: Add final wall - leave a gap for the door. <br />Step 5: Add roof and door
<p> Things I have learned while building the run:
<p> 1) Chicken wire really hurts when you lose your grip on it. <br />2) Every project will need more materials than you think. <br />3) You can't make chicken wire stretch tight across anything - there is too much give. <br />4) The ground in my backyard is really hard to dig into. <br />Here are the pictures, enjoy!
