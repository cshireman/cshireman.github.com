<p>Today I find pleasure in the little things in my life, like a kiss on the cheak form my 13 month old daughter, and a universal remote that actually controls all of my devices without difficulty.  It's been a long week, so I will keep this short.  Have a great weekend and remember to take note of the small pleasures in life.</p>
