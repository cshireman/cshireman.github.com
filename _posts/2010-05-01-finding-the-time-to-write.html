    I have a very, very busy life. I have a full time job and a family, enough said. This doesn't leave very much time to write promotional articles and setup affiliate sites or blogs. The only way I manage to do it is to maximize the little bit of downtime that I have by writing at every possible spare moment. This actually end up working out great, and you would be surprised how much you can write while you are waiting for the network router at the office to reboot or while you are sitting in the car (not driving) on your way someplace. I will keep this post short since I am getting ready for bed, but I just wanted to remind those of you that read this blog on a regular basis to take every opportunity to create content. You never know how much you can write until you try.
