    So, my wife tells me this morning that she found an article detailing the reasons why microwaves are bad. Basically the idea is that nuking anything is really bad for you - like cancer causing bad. So, for 1 week we are going to try and live without our microwave. My first thought is 'No Popcorn' - but now we are going to get the stove-top stuff for tonight and look into getting a full-on popcorn popper. We are also talking about getting a convection oven for the counter top. Personally, I want to wait until the end of the week before we buy anything major - just to see if we can break the microwave addiction. I know that lunch time will be difficult due to the time constraints. I'll report back at the end of the week to let everyone know how we did.</p>
