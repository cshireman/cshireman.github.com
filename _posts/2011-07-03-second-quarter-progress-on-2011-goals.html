<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px;">
<div>It's the end of the second quarter, time for a half way point progress report on my goals for the year:</div>
<p /></div>
<div><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>I will bring my automatic monthly income up to $10,000 with new online services I will create by the end of the year.</div>
<p>
<div>Progress: I am making between $4000 and $8000 per month, but hardly any of it is automatic. &nbsp;I'm still looking for ideas, but with all the clients I have who want iPhone apps I have my hands full. &nbsp;The catch 22 is that in order to setup automated income, I need seed money. &nbsp;In order to get seed money I need to work on client projects. &nbsp;Plus there always seems to be a large, unexpected bill that comes in to eat up all my extra funding.</div>
<p>
<div>2) &nbsp;I will weigh 198 lbs. by July 31<sup>st</sup>.</div>
<p>
<div>Progress: &nbsp;Current weight lost: 55.5lbs. &nbsp;Current weight: 208.5lbs. &nbsp;I have been noticing a slow in the amount of weight I have been losing lately, so I may not reach the target weight by my deadline, but I have still accomplished a lot with this particular project.</div>
<p>
<div><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>I will create and publish 5 new iPhone apps to the App Store.</div>
<p>
<div>Progress: Total number of apps published this year: 1. &nbsp;Heather and some of her Mommy friends came up with a fun app idea. &nbsp;Stay tuned for more details. &nbsp;I also have a little weather app that I need to get published.</div>
<p>
<div><span><span>6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>I will pay off the water filter by the end of the year ($3,000)</div>
<p>
<div>Progress: &nbsp;I have started making higher payments on this debt, and it is coming down much faster than before. &nbsp;There is still a lot to pay off, but the current schedule is much improved. &nbsp;I'm not sure if I will get all of it paid off by the end-of-year deadline, but I will certainly be much closer than I am now.</div>
<p>
<div><span><span>7)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>I will pay off my credit card by the end of the year ($10,000)</div>
<p>
<div>Progress: This doesn't look like it is going to happen. &nbsp;I'm of course making payments, but it isn't moving nearly fast enough.</div>
<p>
<div><span><span>8)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>I will test 3 new muse ideas by June 1<sup>st</sup>.</div>
<p>
<div>Progress: Complete failure on this one. &nbsp;I haven't tested anything since the last report. &nbsp;This goal has been dropped from my list for now. &nbsp;I have more important things to worry about.</div></p></p></p></p></p></p>
