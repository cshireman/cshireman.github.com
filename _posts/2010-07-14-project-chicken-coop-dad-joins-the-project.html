<div>Unknown to either myself or anyone else, my family has decided to come down and visit this week.&nbsp; They didn't even know they were coming until the day before they left, but I am glad they are here none the less.&nbsp; My Dad has been helping me with the chicken coop this week, and we have made a HUGE amount of progress.&nbsp; All four walls are up, and despite my best attempts, the corner posts are actually straight!&nbsp; There was also enough time last night to get the windows in, so this thing is really starting to take shape.&nbsp; My Dad will be able to help me one more day, so I really hope we can get the roof framing up while I have the help.&nbsp; It's finally starting to look like a building!!! Here are a couple of pictures I took this morning.</div>
<div>Next Steps: Roof Framing, Nesting Boxes, then the plywood walls go up!</div>
