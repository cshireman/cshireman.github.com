<p>
    The pint of this blog is to keep track of and dial in the amount of coffee beans required to make the perfect cup of coffee, at least in my opinion. The plan is to measure the amount of water and amount of beans each morning along with a rating of the results for that day.  This will start tomorrow, there is too much gong on today, and coffee will be purchased elsewhere.</p>
