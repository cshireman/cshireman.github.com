<p>As I have stated previously, I do not make resolutions. &nbsp;I find that resolutions are easily forgotten or broken. &nbsp;I do however create goals and projects. &nbsp;Such things are far more well defined and can thus be broken down into smaller pieces in order to determine progress and success.</p>
<p>Here is my very short list for 2013:</p>
<ol>
<li>Publish at least one iPhone app to the app store each month as part of my app network. &nbsp;Each app should take no longer than 2 weeks to create given a 1-2 hour per night schedule.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Make at least $10,000 total from the app store using my app network. &nbsp;I currently only have one app in the network that is making any reasonable amount of money, about $360 per year. &nbsp;If I have increase the average from $30 per month to $1000 per month, per app I should get this. &nbsp;Adventures in app marketing.</li>
<li>Pay off our computer, bed, water filter, and credit card debt: &nbsp;Total amount = $13,700</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. &nbsp;Nothing fancy.</p>
<p>Happy New Year everyone!</p>
