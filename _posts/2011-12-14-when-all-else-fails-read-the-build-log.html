<p>I just spent the last several hours searching for the cause of an error in one of my mobile app projects. &nbsp;Keep in mind that this same project already works in the simulator on iPhone and iPad. &nbsp;I was trying to get it to build for the actuall device, and I ran into this error &nbsp;This particular error manifested itself as an error in the compiler with the oh-so-helpful statement that it was SystemCode: 65. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After a lot of searching online and several dead ends, I finally figured out that this particular error seems to be a catch-all for the Appcelerator compiler whenever anything goes wrong with the Xcode build of an app. &nbsp;In my particular case a module that talks to Google Analytics was the source of my frustration. &nbsp;I downloaded an updated version of the module and it now seems to work perfectly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't figure this out by asking for help from other developers on some random forums or some fantastic tutorial on how get apps distributed for testing with Titanium. No, I finally broke down and read through the build log. &nbsp;I know, seems like an obvious answer, but it is kind of like asking for directions - it's almost an insult to my ego that I would stoop so low as to actually read through the build log. &nbsp;I know, it's stupid, but the truth. &nbsp;Let this be a lesson to any other developers who think they know better than the compiler -- YOU DON'T.</p>
<p>In any case, it solved the problem. &nbsp;The app now builds and installs on my device. &nbsp;Hopefully the client will find it to their liking :). &nbsp;It's 12:15 in the morning, I'm going to sleep right after I send the app to the client.</p>
