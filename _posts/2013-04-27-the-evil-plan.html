description: So, what is my evil plan and why would I have one?  In a nut shell the evil plan is to publish a new app to the Apple iOS app store every two weeks.  Each app is part of my own personal app network that helps build up an income stream. Slowly, after I have published many apps, the income stream will build to the point that I no longer REQUIRE a job to make ends meet.

<p>So, what is my evil plan and why would I have one?  In a nut shell the evil plan is to publish a new app to the Apple iOS app store every two weeks.  Each app is part of my own personal app network that helps build up an income stream. Slowly, after I have published many apps, the income stream will build to the point that I no longer REQUIRE a job to make ends meet.</p>
<p>It's an important distinction - the requirement of a job and the wanting of a job.  Right now I require the job to pay the mortgage and keep everyone from going hungry.  This is the 'Why' of the evil plan: I hate being dependent on a source of income that could potentially be taken away at a moment's notice.</p>
<p>To get things started, I've spent the last two weeks implementing a very simple little application called DailyWiki.  The purpose of the app is to provide you with a daily dose of education without the cost of tuition.  A random wikipedia article will be chosen on a daily basis.  At the time of your choosing, you will receive a notice on your iPhone that a new article is ready.  Read, enjoy, feel smarter - everyone likes being the know-it-all in the room.</p>
<p>I'll update this post with a link to the new app once it's approved by Apple.   I'm also going to continue posting updates here when I release new apps.  There is no target number of apps, this is primarily an experiment in income stream development. </p>
<p>If anyone else has had success building an income stream like this, please drop me a line, I would love to talk to you about your successes and failures in this market.</p>
<p>Chris</p>
