<p>Heather brought home a really great bottle of wine from a friends wine tasting bachelorette party. It is a Kenneth Volk 2005 Syrah Grenache blend. It is still a central coast blend, so it is heavy on the black cherries, but unlike most local wines it is light on the tannins. There is also some the fruit involved that I can't put my finger on. It's 15% alcohol, so it is a 'beast' that can floor you if you haven't eaten recently. It is a really great bottle of wine, and I am very proud of my wife for choosing an excellent wine.</p>
