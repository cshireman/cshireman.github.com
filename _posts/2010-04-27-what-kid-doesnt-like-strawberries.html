    Honestly, have you ever known a kid that doesn't like Strawberries? Zoe won't eat them, at least while we are at home. She has had them at the farmers market, but she won't eat them at home. She ends up squishing them in-between her fingers and flinging them across the room, usually into the waiting mouths of the dogs. We think that maybe she doesn't like cold food (the strawberries were refrigerated), but heating up strawberries isn't something I want to attempt since they will probably explode in the microwave. In any case, the Strawberry Festival is coming up soon. Hopefully she will get over it by then.</p>
