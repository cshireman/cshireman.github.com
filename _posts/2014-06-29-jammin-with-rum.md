# Making Peach Preserves with Rum

![peach rum preserves](/assets/images/peach_rum.jpg)

I am a purist.  I like things to be simple, easy to work with, easy to reproduce, and always tasty.  My wife on the other hand likes to experiment a bit more.  Given that aspect of her personality, she decided to try to add rum to our peach preserves.

## Why rum?

Simple: It's tasty.  It is really the only hard liquir that we use in our home made goods: Vanilla, cleaners, and now peach preserves.  Our first attempt though did not turn out as well as expected.  There was in fact too much experimentation and not enough experience.

## Enter the Internet

Ah, that ever changing landscape of accumulated human knowledge (30% cat videos).  Heather found what seemed like a fantastic recipe for making preserves with rum.  I tried it this weekend, and it was AMAZING!!!  Not quite the consistency we were expecting, and yet delicious.

For those that are curious, you will find the recipe here:

## What's next?

Peaches are winding down, and we just traded out some of our Strawberry Jam for Appricot.  I know we wanted to try combining Jalapenos with some stone fruit.  I also know Heather wants me to can some of my Salsa.  I've never tried canning it before, so that will be entertaining.
