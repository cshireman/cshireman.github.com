<p>As promised, here is an update on the goals I set at the beginning of the year:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">I will bring my automatic monthly income up to $10,000 with new online services I will create by the end of the year.</span><br /><em>Progress: Unfortunately not much progress on this goal. &nbsp;I have plenty of active income, but I haven't made any progress on the automatic income.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">I will weigh 190 lbs. by July 31</span><sup style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">st</sup><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">.</span><br /><em>Progress: I am really excited about this goal. &nbsp;I started the year weighing 264lbs. &nbsp;I am currently down to 232.5lbs as of this morning. &nbsp;That is only 1.5lbs above the half way mark. &nbsp;After I posted this goal I looked up my supposed 'ideal' weight - it's 198lbs, so that is my new target weight. &nbsp;Heather thought that 190lbs was a little too low and the internet agrees. &nbsp;In any case, I feel better and look better. &nbsp;I will save pictures until this goal is complete, but it is very exciting to make so much progress in so little time. &nbsp;At the current rate I should complete this goal around the end of June or the beginning of July, ahead of schedule!</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;"><em>&nbsp;</em></span><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">I will pay off my car by June 1</span><sup style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">st</sup><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">. ($3000)</span><br /><em>Progress: Complete! &nbsp;I paid my car off with out federal tax return in mid March.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">I will create and publish 5 new iPhone apps to the App Store.</span><br /></span><em><span>Progress: I am currently in the middle of creating a new app called eButterfly - Heathers' idea. &nbsp;It not only allows<span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">&nbsp;you to view the streams from multiple social networks at the same time, but it allows to to cross-post between the networks. &nbsp;See something you like on facebook? &nbsp;Re-tweet it on Twitter and post it on MySpace. &nbsp;I should be able to complete that project by the end of this month.</span></span></em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;"><em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">I&nbsp;will purchase an iPad by April 2</span><sup style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">nd</sup><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">. ($600)</span><br /></span><span>Progress: After receiving a birthday gift last night from my in-laws I have the funding to purchase the new iPad 2. &nbsp;I had an iPad 1, but returned it in favor of the iPad 2. &nbsp;However the funds from that return were used to cover medical insurance that month. &nbsp;I started setting small amount of cash aside from my completed projects, and the gift last night pushed the balance to within $3 - which I am happy to cover. &nbsp;I will be purchasing the iPad 2 at the Apple Store either today or tomorrow! &nbsp;Right on time - Complete!</span></em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;"><em><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-style: normal;"><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>I will pay off the water filter by the end of the year ($3,000)<br /></span>Progress: &nbsp;I have started making larger payments on this now that we don't have the car payment to worry about. &nbsp;I haven't commited the full amount of the car payment to it yet due to medical expenses surrounding Heathers pregnancy. &nbsp;I am expecting a few larger projects to close this month so I should have plenty of extra cash to put towards paying off the water filter.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;"><em><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-style: normal;">I&nbsp;will pay off my credit card by the end of the year ($10,000)<br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Progress: &nbsp;I have moved all automatic transactions away from this credit card and have been paying at least $200 per month on it, which is just above the minimum. &nbsp;However, since the interest rate is so low (7.9%) this still allows for a large portion of the monthly payment to go towards the principle. &nbsp;It is currently down to approximately $9,300, so at this point it looks like I will miss this target unless a very large project comes my way.&nbsp;</span></em></span></li>
<li><em><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;"><span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-style: normal;">I will test 3 new muse ideas by June 1<sup>st</sup>.<br /></span>Progress: I started with the idea of a simple WordPress installation service that I could build up and then outsource to a virtual assistant. &nbsp;The site is still up - wpblogsinstalled.com, but I found that I had too much active programming work to maintain it and the cost of aquiring customers was too high when compared to the amount I was charging. &nbsp;I will return to this idea later, but for now it is on hold. &nbsp;There haven't been any other ideas for automated muses, but I will keep looking and doing brain storming sessions until I come up with something I like.</span></span></em></li>
</ol>
<p><em><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 21px; font-size: 14px;">That's everything, and so far completing 2 major goals for the year seems like good progress for 1/4 of the year - 1/4 of the goals. &nbsp;Even though it looks like I will miss on a couple of these I will still strive to complete them. &nbsp;Progress towards a goal is still preferable to standing still. &nbsp;I will publish my next progress report on July 1st, at the start of the next quarter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
