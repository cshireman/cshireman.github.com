<p>I spent a solid 6 months developing my first iPhone app, and I like it very much.&nbsp; However, in order to keep sales going I need to get some reviews and links up as quickly as possible.&nbsp; To that end, I am willing to give my app away to the first 40 people that comment on this posting.&nbsp; My only condition for receiving the app for free is that you review the app in the app store and that you make a post on Facebook or Twitter about my app.&nbsp; Here is the link you can post in your status update: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23fht2s" title="That Reminds Me">http://tinyurl.com/23fht2s</a>.&nbsp; The link will open iTunes to my app page, so you will need this link to write your review.&nbsp; I'll post again when all 40 free copies are given away.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>
<p>Chris</p>
