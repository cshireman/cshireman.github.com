    It's not what it sounds like, I am not stricken with anything that might end my life. I have a cold and stayed home from work today. Who gets a cold in May anyway? Heather seems to think that it is Allergies, but I have my doubts. I have never had allergies in the past so why should I get them now? The only other thing I can think of is that there are a lot of new people in the office and they all brought their very own germs to work - ugh. Anyway, I'm sick and I feel horrible.
<p> Speaking of things that are Horrible, I was recently introduced to an internet movie that was released back in 2008 with the Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Houser) and Nathan Fillion (Rick Castle) called Dr. Horribles Sing-a-long Blog: <a href="http://drhorrible.com">http://drhorrible.com</a>. This is a really fun little movie about an up and coming super villain who likes to sing (aparently so does everyone else) about his various problems, mostly his love interest who happens to also be involved with Captain Hammer, his nemesis. Thanks for Jasmine for introducing Heather and I to this.
<p> That's all for now, it's coming up on dinner time and Zoe needs some attention.
