<p>I just finished reading an article about when you are the most creative, and it turns out that you are the most creative when you are either tired or drunk. &nbsp;Both of these conditions have to do with the fact that your brain is allowed to wonder and not focus on any particular task. &nbsp;I just happen to have had some wine this evening and I am quite tired. &nbsp;Hence the origins of this post: The drunk post.</p>
<p>What kind of ideas can I come up with?</p>
<p>How about an app to help you de-stress when dealing with potty training your child?</p>
<p>How about an online web service that lets you keep track of different time-senstitive events throughout the day to discover patterns that you would otherwise miss?</p>
<p>A simple way to manage all your chores and automate them away? &nbsp;Might be interesting. &nbsp;Actually, I think that is what TaskRabbit is all about.</p>
<p>What kind of pancake recipies can I create? &nbsp;We already have a great Coconut Pancake recipe - maybe something with Mangos? Other tropical fruit? &nbsp; Pineapple pancakes sound tasty. &nbsp;What else?</p>
<p>Need to find the best landscaper around - I'm trying to outsource this to India, maybe it could work.</p>
<p>What else can I think of? &nbsp;I'm not quite sure, but I it will be a few days before I figure something else out. &nbsp;I'm getting close to the end of this post and thought it would be a great idea to link out to the original article I found. &nbsp;Here it is:

<p>Thanks for reading my randomness this evening. &nbsp;I hope everyone has a fun Thursday tomorrow.</p>

<p>P.S. Norton Malbec 2008 was my vintage of choice this evening.</p></p>
