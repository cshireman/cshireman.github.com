    For those of you that don't know, I am on the Slow-Carb diet. This diet has a unique feature - a binge day once per week. On this day all the rules of the diet are thrown out the window, I can eat anything that I want - and I do. The diet also encourages you to over-eat to the point of making yourself a little sick, which is done to help prevent cheating during the rest of the week. This plan works well for me, I have lost 58.5lbs using this approach. Just for fun, I decided to film a little video-blog entry for this binge day. I have never done one and I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Here is the result of my effort, and no - it is not a video of me eat tons of food, but rather me talking about what is going on around me and how I feel throughout the day. Enjoy my slow decent into junk-food madness!
