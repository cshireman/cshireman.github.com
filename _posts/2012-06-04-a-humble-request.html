<p>I know this is shameless, but I need some help getting as many entries in this contest as I can. &nbsp;The winner gets their mortgage paid for free next month! &nbsp;My chances are slim, but every entry counts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Why would you do this? &nbsp;Because you get the same chance that I do when you enter - to get your mortgage or rent paid for free next month! &nbsp;Actually you are entering to win $2001 dollars - sent directly as a check to you - no questions asked. &nbsp;Use a fake email if you want, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>
