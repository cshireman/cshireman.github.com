<p>It would seem that in my quest to produce simple applications for the iPhone I have run into an issue with Apple.  They believe my initial app is too simple, and as such has been rejected.  So, I need to re-vamp the concept of the daily wikipedia notification to be something a bit more unique.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head I can already see that the 'pro' features of the app are probably going to be required for even the free version in order to get acceptance.  I will also need to see if there is a way I can pull the content I was planning on displaying via an API so I can do some custom formatting.</p>
<p>As for additional features, I was thinking of adding a randomize button to get another random article on demand.  I still need to come up with more features, and that will take time.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the even plan as a whole?  It's one app, and each rejection is a learning experience for the next app.  Can I add more cool features into my apps ahead of time: Yes.  Can I produce really cool features on my own in my original timeframe: probably not.</p>
<p>Here is what I will do:  I'll shelve the DailyWiki app for now while I brainstorm some new ideas.  I'm also going to go back to the app store and do some more extensive research and brainstorming to help prevent this issue with the next app.  I haven't decided on what the next app will be, so this is the perfect time to really nail that down.  Will I be able to produce apps on my two-week delivery schedule, probably not given the amount of time I can spend on them.  The research phase however, can still fit within the one week time frame.</p>
<p>Failure is required for learning, so let the learning begin.</p>
