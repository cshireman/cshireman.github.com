<p>It has been WAY more than a week since we stopped using the microwave, it's been almost 2 months! &nbsp;The first week is the hardest. &nbsp;We actually had a couple of slip-ups mostly out of habit I think. &nbsp;We actually had to place an 'Out of Order' sign on the door handle to remind us not to use the thing. &nbsp;After about two weeks, we didn't miss it or have any inclination to use it.
<p>I will say that the microwave does make things easier to do some times. &nbsp;We are washing a lot of pots several times per day. &nbsp;When you can't use the microwave, you have to use the stove top. &nbsp;The oven is the next big thing that gets used nearly every day. You also need to plan ahead a bit if you have a limited amount of time to prepare a meal - like on my lunch break. &nbsp;I actually have a reminder set to go off at 11:45am to prompt me to pre-heat the oven if I have to.</p>
<p>We also had to make a shift in some of the types of things we make. &nbsp;We can't make microwave popcorn any more, so we now have an actual pop-corn popper. &nbsp;I absolutely love it, as I now have direct control over the amount of salt, butter, and other seasonings that go into the popcorn. &nbsp;I have been nearly obsessed with making the perfect movie-style popcorn from scratch, and I'm getting pretty close. &nbsp;Hint: clarified butter, coconut oil, and popcorn salt in just the right proportions - yummy!</p>
<p>Overall, switching to a non-microwave household isn't all that difficult, you just have to get used to it. Everything seems to taste just a little but better, and while there are more dishes to be done, it's just something you get used to. &nbsp;Definitely glad we made the switch.</p></p>
