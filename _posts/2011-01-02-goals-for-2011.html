    Here is a list of my goals for 2011. &nbsp;I don't make resolutions as they have a tendency to be abandonded and not well defined. &nbsp;A goal however must be well defined in order for you to reach it. &nbsp;Here are mine for this year:
<div><span><span>1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>I will bring my automatic monthly income up to $10,000 with new online services I will create by the end of the year.</div>
<div>2) &nbsp;I will weigh 190 lbs. by July 31<sup>st</sup>.</div>
<div>3) I will pay off my car by June 1<sup>st</sup>. ($3000)</div>
