    It's absolutely amazing to me how much you can get done when the distractions are removed. Over the last two days I have put just over 12 hours into a project. In that 12 hours, I accomplished what as slated to take 2 weeks under normal circumstances. This is incredible, but it doesn't come for free. Just because you block out the distractions for a little while, it doesn't make them go away - they just pile up. I know that there will be a lot of small problems waiting for me when I go back to the office tomorrow, and that's ok because the major project that I am working on is now back on schedule. To paraphrase Tim Ferris: To get some really good things done, sometimes you have to let a few bad things happen.
